Bertie-Barnard-Screensaver
==========================

Commerce I.T. moved to sponsor a computer lab for the Bertie Barnard Primary School situated in Stilbaai. A request was made for a personalised screensaver. The actual screensaver is a flash animation whilst the screensaver program uses Simple Screensaver 1.0 to display the flash animation.   Created by Craig Lotter, October 2004
